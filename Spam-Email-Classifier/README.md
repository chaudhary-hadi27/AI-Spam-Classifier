# 📬 Spam Email Classifier - ML Pipeline (SVM & XGBoost)

Welcome to the **Spam Email Classification Project**, designed to detect spam emails using state-of-the-art machine learning models.  
This project follows an end-to-end ML pipeline involving **data preprocessing**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, **model training**, and a **full-stack interface** built with **Flask + Next.js**.

---

## 🚀 Current Version: `Model_v1`

Our current stable release is:

- ✅ `Model_v1`: Trained using **SVM** and **XGBoost**
- 🧠 Based on real-world testing, **SVM** shows better generalization and is currently the preferred model.

📘 For complete details about the dataset, training/evaluation, and backend/frontend integration:

➡️ **Check the full documentation here:**  
[`Model_v1/README.md`](Model_v1/README.md)

## 🧪 Upcoming Release: `Model_v2`

We're actively working on the next iteration:

- 📈 Improved preprocessing and feature engineering
- 🧠 Aiming for even better accuracy and performance
- 🌐 API improvements and enhanced UX for the web app


Stay tuned for **`Model_v2`**, launching soon with better performance and scalability!
